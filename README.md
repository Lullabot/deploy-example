# Deploy Example
The repository provides an example for how to push compiled code to a remote
Git repository, such as Pantheon or Acquia.

## Use Case
This is primarily intended for smaller clients that do not the staff or budget
to manage more complex CI implementations, such as CircleCI or GitHub Actions.

## Know issues
Removing modules does not seem to work.

## Recognition
Thank you to James Sansbury and Hawkeye Tenderwolf for their help with this.
But, if there is anything that looks really weird here, it was definitely all
my fault.
